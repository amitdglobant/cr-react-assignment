# Code Realm - Nov ’19: React Assignment

# Description

The existing app is a simple Incidents Logger app. The Home screen shows all current incidents in the paginated form along with Add button on Home Screen. Each incident has a title, description, id and edit field. The app has been generated with create react-app version. The Details Screen shows the particular incident detail info. The layout of app is developed using reactstrap.
You have to perform the following tasks -

## Minimum requirements:

- Enable Add incident functionality: On clicking the button, user should be able to add a new incident. The incident should have a unique id.
- Enable ‘Edit Incident’ functionality: There is an edit link that enables user to edit the title, description in a modal form. - - The form should contains save button. On pressing save button data should update in existing table.
- Use state management library of your choice to persist data and handle side effects.

## Good to have -

- Add Delete Incident functionality: On clicking delete incident, user should be able to remove the incident from the table
- Use Local storage to persist data. If user refreshes the page, he should still see the newly added incidents.

## Brownie points-

- Refactor existing components to make the code more reusable.
- Unit test: An overall test coverage of 80% is desirable.

## Please note -

The ability to execute unit tests is already baked in so you don’t have to make any configuration changes to enable it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
